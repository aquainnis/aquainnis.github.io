# Content Backup

This directory contains backup copies of content from the original Academia Hugo theme that was moved during site restructuring.

## Directory Structure

### `content-original/`
Contains original theme content directories that were moved out of the main content folder:

- **`post/`** - Original blog post structure (replaced by new category-based organization)
- **`publication/`** - Academic publications section (**RESTORED** as `content/publications/`)
- **`talk/`** - Academic talks and presentations
- **`slides/`** - Presentation slides
- **`courses/`** - Course content and materials

## Purpose

- `projects/` - Project showcases
- `case-studies/` - Case studies and outcomes
- `services/` - Service offerings
- `news/` - News and updates (date-organized)
- `publications/` - Academic publications and research papers

## Date Created

## Safe to Delete?
Yes, these backups can be safely deleted once you've confirmed the new structure meets all your needs and you've migrated any content you want to keep.
